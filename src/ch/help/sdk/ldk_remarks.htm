Because many people have been writing recently about the translation stuff - I have made this Language Development Kit.<br><br>
To get rid of many other problems - there are some rules about the translation process (regarding only the people that wants their translation to be shipped with program or put on our web page):
<ul>
<li>Send me the <b>finished</b> translation. No partially finished, but fully (either a program translation or program+help translation)</li>
<li>If you do not want to be surprised that someone else has finished the translation (in your native language) before you - please inform me (by sending mail to <a href="mailto:copyhandler@o2.pl">copyhandler@o2.pl</a>) that you will translate the stuff. In the situation where some other person already have started doing the job (or has volunteered to do so before you) - let me know if you want me to give that person your e-mail address (and vice versa) or just to inform you that someone is doing the stuff.</li>
<li>You can always do the parallel translation so there would be two of them ;-]</li>
<li>You have to agree that if someone else will volunteer to do the same job as you and want the mail exchange (look @above) - I will give him/her your e-mail address (and I will send his/her e-mail address to you).</li>
<li>You definitely have to sign in to the discussion group 'chdev' (the current mail addresses are in the program's about box). I will send there any modifications that has been made by me to the original file(s).</li>
<li>When I will be about to release the new version of program I will send the info about his plans to this group so anyone would get to work and incorporate the changes to the translation. When this fact occurs I will wait full week (7 days) for your translations to appear on my e-mail account (<a href="mailto:copyhandler@o2.pl">copyhandler@o2.pl</a>). After this time I will release the program only with the translations that has been updated (maybe I will wait a few additional days - but not always).</li>
</ul>

<br>
I you have any questions - send it to me or post on the discussion list (copyhandler or chdev - depends on the topic) - the current addresses are in the about box in the program.
