THIS CODE IS NOT A MASTERPIECE, SO DON'T EXPECT THAT IT'S FULLY OPTIMIZED OR STH.
IT'S VERY INEFFECTIVE, SLOW AND BUGGY, SO IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS - SEND ME A MAIL TO copyhandler@o2.pl,
OR BETTER - SUBSCRIBE THE DISCUSSION FORUM CHDEV (AS STATED IN README FILE OF THE PROGRAM).
ANY HELP OR COMMENTS WOULD BE HIGHLY APPRECIATED.

How to build it ?
-----------------
You have to change some paths in the files included in the project - which one ? Try to build it and you'll know.
Add the App framework folder and folder where debug.h is placed to the include directories in tools->options->directories. I do not include "build manager.exe" - it's the program for counting builds. Just remove all references to it. If something is missing - please let me know.

What do you need to build it ? (This is the minimum to build a program)
------------------------------
- Visual Studio 6.0.

But I suggest to use the following:
- Service Pack 5 for Visual Studio 6.0
- Platform SDK February 2003
- UPX Software for executable compression
